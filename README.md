# 🚀 Full-Stack Web Development Journey

Welcome to my learning journey as I dive into the world of full-stack web development! This repository (and others that follow) will document everything from the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to advanced backend development with Node.js, Express, databases, and beyond.

📌 Goals:
- Master front-end development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React)
- Build dynamic backends with Node.js and Express
- Work with databases (MongoDB, PostgreSQL)
- Learn deployment and version control using Git & GitHub
- Create real-world full-stack projects

🛠️ Tech Stack (planned):
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React
- Backend: Node.js, Express
- Database: MongoDB / PostgreSQL
- Tools: Git, GitHub, VS Code

Follow along and watch this evolve into full-stack mastery!
